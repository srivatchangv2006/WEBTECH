            <div class="project-subtitle">May 2025 – June 2025 | Apache Kafka, Azure Blob Storage, Python, Folium, LSTM</div>
            <p>This project involved designing a robust real-time vehicle telemetry analysis system capable of ingesting, storing, and visualizing high-frequency sensor data. Apache Kafka served as the messaging backbone, continuously collecting data such as speed, fuel consumption, and engine behavior from connected vehicles.</p>
            <p>I wrote Python-based consumer pipelines to process and clean the data in real time before storing it in Azure Blob Storage for long-term retention and scalable access. A rich dashboard was developed that visualized vehicle routes using Folium — interactive maps showed trip paths with annotations for harsh events like overspeeding or sudden braking.</p>
            <p>A key innovation was the integration of an LSTM-based model to capture sequential driver behavior patterns. The model detected anomalies and patterns indicative of inefficient or aggressive driving styles. I also explored a reimbursement strategy for inefficient trips, where drivers could be penalized or rewarded based on metrics derived from model predictions.</p>

            <div class="project-title">Gym Membership Management System</div>
            <div class="project-subtitle">February 2025 – March 2025 | PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</div>
            <p>I developed a full-stack web application to handle gym operations — from member registration and login to plan management and activity tracking. The system provided role-based access where admins could onboard users, define subscription plans, and monitor attendance logs.</p>
            <p>MySQL served as the backend storage for user credentials, plan history, and login activity. PHP handled the server-side logic for validating inputs, rendering dynamic pages, and triggering plan-related notifications. I incorporated JavaScript for client-side validation and used responsive HTML/CSS to ensure mobile compatibility.</p>
            <p>A key feature was the implementation of check-in/check-out tracking and email-based reminders for expired plans, helping improve member engagement. The system also focused on data integrity and session management to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

            <div class="project-title">Automated Light System using Motion Detection</div>
            <div class="project-subtitle">December 2024 – January 2025 | Python, OpenCV, HOG + SVM, Mediapipe</div>
            <p>This project aimed to develop an intelligent lighting system that activates based on human motion and presence detection in low-light conditions. Using frame differencing and background subtraction techniques via OpenCV, the system identified significant motion in the camera’s field of view.</p>
            <p>To ensure high accuracy, I implemented a hybrid detection model combining HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to detect human figures in real time. Additionally, Mediapipe was used as a secondary validation layer to confirm human presence and reduce false positives.</p>
            <p>The system was configured to automatically switch lights on when motion was detected and turn them off after a configurable timeout period of inactivity. It was tested in a dark-room lab setting with impressive precision and robustness.</p>
            
            <div class="project-title">AI-Powered Student Learning Web App</div>
            <div class="project-subtitle">VIT Spectrum Hackathon – April 2025 | Django REST Framework, React, TypeScript, Gemini AI API</div>
            <p>During the 24-hour VIT Spectrum Hackathon, I collaborated with a team to design and prototype a smart learning platform that automates the transformation of educational PDFs into engaging, interactive story-based content. The application used Google’s Gemini AI API to extract textual data from PDFs, reorganize it into coherent narratives, and generate contextual quiz questions to test comprehension.</p>
            <p>The backend was developed using Django REST Framework and managed endpoints for file upload, AI interaction, and quiz storage. On the frontend, I used React with TypeScript to build an intuitive interface that allowed students to view AI-generated stories and take quizzes seamlessly.</p>
            <p>This project allowed me to integrate modern AI APIs into a functional educational system and improve full-stack coordination. It also gave me hands-on experience with prompt engineering, RESTful architecture, and frontend UX practices under intense time constraints.</p>
